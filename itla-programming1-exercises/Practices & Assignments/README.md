## 🎉 Overview

Welcome to the **Simple Console Calculator**! This calculator is built using C# and runs in your console. It helps you perform basic arithmetic operations with ease, all while simulating a classic calculator interface. Whether you're a math enthusiast or just need quick calculations, this tool will do the job. 💻🔢

## ✨ Features

- ➕ **Basic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- 🎛️ **Simulated Numpad**: Displays a visual number pad in the console, giving you the feel of a real calculator.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Display**: The calculator will continuously show the current expression and result as you enter numbers and operations.
2. **Perform Operations**: After entering a number, choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to continue building your calculation.
3. **Complete Calculation**: Press `=` to see the final result. 📊
4. **Clear**: Hit `C` to start fresh, clearing the current expression and resetting the result to `0`.
5. **Exit**: Type `exit` to leave the program when you're done. 😎

## 🔢 Example Usage

1. Start by entering a number (`7`), followed by an operation (`+`).
2. Enter another number (`3`), then press `=`.
